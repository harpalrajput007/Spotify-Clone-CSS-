# 🎵 Spotify Clone (CSS Mini Project)

A clean and simple **Spotify UI clone** created using **HTML and CSS**. This project replicates the front-end design of the Spotify web player, built purely with static elements for practice and showcasing UI skills. It's part of a mini project for my web development journey.
